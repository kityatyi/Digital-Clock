Digital Clock

Thank you for checking out my first ever JavaScript project that is worth mentioning, at least the first which actually does something useful. I have been learning JavaScript for about a month now using Mark Myers' book titled "A Smarter Way to Learn Javascript" as well as various other online resources such as video tutorials. This particular project was inspired by one of them.

Initially, all I wanted was a working digital clock, without any graphic elements. Literally, all I wanted was the time in the desired format. Nothing more, nothing less. Then I started experimenting and added some CSS, which then resulted in a selectable dark and night theme. Later I also added the option to switch between 12 and 24-hour formats. Who knows what else will follow. I find these projects an excellent way to learn JavaScript. As an absolute beginner, I find them not only educational but also rewarding.

Long story short, enjoy and feel free to further enhance it should you so wish.
